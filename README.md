-Partial Submission for Assignment2
 -
 -I had many issues with the framework/deploying to heroku due to attempting to use Windows as my development platform.
 -In the end, I was able to somewhat have a working local version, but it would not allow me to push my work to heroku.
 -
 -This git is as up to date as I could get, but it still did not adequately satisfy the assignment requirements.
 -
 -I was able to create the multiple tables, and attempted to link them all together, along with their respective viewing pages.
 -However, the issues I ran into limited any functionality beyond that.
 -
 -This is (sadly) an attempt to obtain the partial marks for correctly submitting the git/app links.
 -
 -Thank you.
